# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
This Prolog-based Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to take turns marking a 3x3 grid, checking for a winner or a draw after each move. Using Prolog’s logical querying, it validates moves and determines the game’s outcome, making it a great demonstration of Prolog’s suitability for turn-based logic games.
